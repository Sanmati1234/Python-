# Python Basics Guide

Small teaching repository demonstrating core Python concepts and two tiny projects.

Structure:

- `basics/` — short example modules for variables, data types, conditions, loops, functions, and OOP.
- `projects/` — small runnable examples: `calculator.py` and `number_guessing_game.py`.

Run examples with:

```powershell
python "python-basics-guide\projects\number_guessing_game.py"
python "python-basics-guide\projects\calculator.py"
```
